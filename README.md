### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hey there, I'm The Anh, and I'm passionate about gaming, anime, and programming. I love diving into virtual worlds and experiencing new stories, and I also enjoy the creative challenge of programming. Some of my favorite games include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and the Persona series, and I'm a big fan of anime like Naruto and Your Lie in April. When I'm not gaming or watching anime, you can usually find me coding up a new project or exploring new technologies.
